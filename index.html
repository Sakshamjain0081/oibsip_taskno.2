                    Pratap Singh, popularly known as the Maharana Pratap, was the 13th Maharana of Mewar known for his valiant and spirited defence against the Mughal Empire. He was one of the bravest Rajput rulers of India, who ruled Mewar in Rajasthan for 35 years. While other Rajput rulers accepted the supremacy of Akbar, he was one of the few rulers in Indian history who stood firm against the mighty Mughal Empire.

                    Maharana Pratap belonged to the Sisodia clan of the Rajputs of Mewar. He was born on 9th May 1540 to Udai Singh II and Jaiwanta Bai. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Maharana Pratap was married to Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia.
                    <br> Upon the death of Udai Singh in 1572 there was a brief tussle on who would succeed the throne of Mewar. Maharana Pratap had other stepbrothers who were also vying for the throne of Mewar. However, the senior nobles in his father’s court wanted Pratap Singh to succeed as he was the eldest son of Udai Singh II, thus Maharana Pratap took over the throne of Mewar’s royal family at the age of 32 on 1st March 1572.

                    On June 18, 1576, Maharana Pratap Singh fought against Akbar's forces led by Man Singh I of Amer in the Battle of Haldighati. The Mughals were triumphant and killed a large number of Mewaris, but they were unable to capture the Maharana.The fighting took place in a narrow mountain pass near Gogunda, which is now known as Rajsamand in Rajasthan. Pratap Singh had about 3000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers on his side. Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army of 5000–10,000 soldiers, was the Mughal commander. The Maharana was wounded and the day was lost after a fierce fight that lasted more than six hours. He was able to flee to the hills and return to the battle the next day.
                    <br> The Mughals were unable to destroy or capture Maharana Pratap Singh or any of his close family members in Udaipur, making Haldighati a meaningless victory. Pratap and his army recaptured the western regions of his dominion as soon as the empire's attention shifted north-west.number 16 Despite the fact that Pratap was able to make a safe escape, the war did not succeed in breaking the deadlock between the two forces. Following that, Akbar waged a concerted war against the Rana, and by the end of it, he had taken possession of Goganda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh.
